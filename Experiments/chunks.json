    "text": "Indian Institute of Information Technology Raichur Internship and Placement Policy (Effective from October 2025) A. Eligibility for Registration in Career Services Cell (CSC) 1. A minimum CGPA of 5.0 (equivalent to 50%) with no active backlog is required for registration in the Career Services Cell (CSC), in line with the graduation requirements prescribed in the Institute Ordinances. 2. Students must maintain this benchmark consistently after every semester, starting from the 5th semester onwards. 3. While the minimum benchmark for CSC registration is a CGPA of 5.0, students are advised that industry opportunities for candidates with CGPA below 6.0 are extremely limited. A CGPA of 6.0 and above should therefore be considered the practical norm for expecting successful placement through the Institute’s on-campus process. B. Classification of Companies (for Placements) 1. There is no classification for internships . The following classification is applicable only for Pre-Placement Offers (PPOs) or Internships leading to PPOs . The specified CTC ranges correspond to compensation offered upon conversion to a full-time role. 2. Companies shall be classified into four blocks: ● Block A : CTC < ₹6 LPA ● Block B : ₹6 LPA ≤ CTC < ₹10 LPA ● Block C : ₹10 LPA ≤ CTC < ₹15 LPA ● Block D : CTC ≥ ₹15 LPA or top-tier companies with global exposure/ESOPs/brand value. 3. CSC reserves the right to amend the classification as per prevailing industry trends. C. Participation in Recruitment (Placement Process) 1. Compulsory Participation until First Offer : ○ Every registered student must apply to all companies for which they meet the eligibility criteria until they secure their first offer. ○ A one-time exemption may be used to skip one company at the student’s discretion. ○ Two opt-outs shall invite temporary debarment from CSC. ○ A maximum of three opt-outs will"

    "text": "F. Off-Campus Opportunities, PPOs & Mandatory Disclosures 1. PPOs obtained through internships must be reported to CSC within one week . 2. Independent off-campus offers must also be reported to CSC within one week. 3. Failure to disclose such offers may result in de-registration from CSC and withholding of no-dues clearance . G. Disclosure of Non-Acceptance of Offers 1. Students must formally inform CSC in case they choose to decline an offer. 2. Failure to do so will be treated as indiscipline and may affect no-dues clearance . H. Accountability and Penalties 1. Absenteeism after Registration ○ Once a student registers for a company, it is mandatory to participate in all stages of the selection process. ○ If a student remains absent after registering, they will be barred from participating in the next two placement drives . This is to discourage casual registrations and ensure fairness for both recruiters and fellow students. 2. Failure to Register for the First Offer ○ Students are required to register for the first offer that comes their way, except in cases where the one-time exemption has not yet been used. ○ If a student does not register for such an opportunity after exhausting their exemption, they will not be allowed to participate in the next placement drive . 3. Repeated Absenteeism or Misconduct ○ Continuous absenteeism, unprofessional conduct, or deliberate disregard of CSC guidelines will be considered a serious violation. ○ Such cases will lead to permanent de-registration from the placement process, thereby forfeiting the student’s right to seek Institute-assisted placements. 4. Providing False Information ○ Any instance of falsification or misrepresentation of information (academic records, resumes, documents, etc.) will result in immediate cancellation of candidature. ○ The concerned student will also face permanent de-registration from CSC, with the matter possibly escalated for disciplinary"
